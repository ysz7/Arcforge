# Screenshots for the landing gallery

Place your app screenshots here. The site expects these filenames by default:

- `01.png` – e.g. graph view
- `02.png` – e.g. node / code view
- `03.png` – e.g. architecture overview

You can rename your files to match, or edit the `galleryImages` array in `src/App.tsx` to use your own filenames and alt text.

Supported formats: PNG, JPG, WebP.
