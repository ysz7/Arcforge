## Arcforge desktop – Changelog

This file is an optional, human-readable log of Arcforge releases.  
You can either keep notes here or rely entirely on GitHub Releases.

### 1.0.1 – Redesign & performance

- **Redesign** of the application.
- **Fewer displayed connections** — the number of edges shown on the graph is reduced; the logic chain and behavior remain the same.
- **Application and connection optimization** — the app and graph rendering are optimized so that **large projects handle graph load better**.

### 1.0.0 – Initial public manifest

- First public version of the Arcforge update manifest.
- Landing page and GitHub Pages configuration documentation.
- JSON schema defined for desktop client integration.

<!--
When you publish a new version:
- Add a new heading here (e.g. "1.3.0 – Feature name").
- Summarize the main changes in a few bullet points.
- Optionally link to the corresponding GitHub Release.
